# Proactively-managing-drinking-water-distribution-networks-A-data-driven-statistical-modelling-appr

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a reliable pipe failure prediction model that identifies areas of drinking water networks most at risk of failure. The results can help to inform decisions for proactive maintenance and help work towards reducing future leakage in the network.

## Files

The RMarkdown files attached here form some of the data-driven approaches taken: 

  1. Appendix A: PipeFailureRate: calcualtes the Poisson mean and 95 % confidence intervals for pipe failure rates. 
  2. Appendix C: GeneralizedAdditiveModel: presents a generalized additive model with Poisson distribution for calculating monthly failure rates.
  3. Appendix D: GradientBoostingDecisionTreeModel: presents a gradient boosting classification tree model.
